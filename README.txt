APCS2 Final Project

Our APCS2 final project is a flight reservation system that harnesses the power of Java's object oriented paradigm to analyze and process big data relating to the world's flight routes, airlines, and airports.

- using the Scanner class in ListMaker.java to input an external file was adapted from the Maze homework
