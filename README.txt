APCS2 Final Project

Our APCS2 final project is a flight reservation system that harnesses the power of Java's object oriented paradigm to analyze and process big data relating to the world's flight routes, airlines, and airports.

How It Works

Concepts Learned This Term Implemented in the Project:
- Parsing a .dat file of CSV's (comma separated values) in the ListMaker class was adapted from the parse method of HW29 Scheme.java.
- Using the Scanner class in ListMaker.java to input an external file was adapted from the Maze homework.
- Getting rid of duplicate layover cities in the transfer methods of Route.java made use of the HashSet class's ability to disperses elements properly among buckets with a hash function.

Error Handling

- User input for the 3 character airport code is made uppercase using the String class's toUpperCase() method and any leading or trailing whitespace is ommited using the String.trim() method.
