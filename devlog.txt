Justin's Logs:
5/26/14 - I created the GitHub repo, submitted the Google form, and emailed Mr. Brown our project proposal.
5/27/14 - Frances and I decided to implement a bottom up approach to programming by coding the Seat, Plane, and Driver classes first, before piecing things together to give rise to the more complex reservation system.
5/28/14 - I found OpenFlights route database in the form of a .dat file, which we can Javafy using the Scanner class. Then, we can use this info to verify that the flights users are requesting exist in real life.
5/29/14 -
